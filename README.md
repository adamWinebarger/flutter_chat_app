Building this project to get more familiar with the capabilities and functionality of flutter with firebase storage, auth, etc., as well as how to implement push notifs in a flutter/firebase project. Was originally going to wait until this project was finished to store it in a git repo, but it looks like we're running into some limited iOS functionality issues while developing with the Linux machine. So this first commit is going to just be an easy way to move it over to the mac

## Things to do still

- implement push notifs on android and iOS
